# leetcode-cpp
My LeetCode problem-solving journey using C++,organized by data structures and algorithms
# LeetCode Solutions (C++)

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems written in **C++**.
The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, master **Data Structures and Algorithms**, and prepare for **software engineering internships**.

## 📌 Structure

Problems are organized by topic:

arrays/
linked-list/
stack/
recursion/
dp/


Each folder contains solutions related to that data structure or concept.

## 🛠️ Conventions

- File names describe the problem clearly  
  Example: `merge_two_sorted_lists.cpp`
- Each solution may include:
  - Approach explanation (in comments)
  - Time complexity


## 🧠 Language

- C++
- C

## 📈 Progress

Problems are added regularly as I solve them on LeetCode.
